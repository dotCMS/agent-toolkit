# Migrate a whole instance

Use this when the user asks to migrate **all** custom fields, every legacy field, or "the whole
instance", not a single pasted VTL file. Two parts do the work, and neither goes through the REST
API directly:

- **The `dotcms` MCP server** does all the I/O with the instance: reading content types,
  downloading and publishing files, updating fields. Authentication belongs to the MCP server;
  never ask for, read or write a token.
- **`scripts/vtl_migration.py`** does the parts that must be exact: classifying fields, deciding
  what to download, the safety gates on every migrated file, and the manifest. It makes no
  network calls and needs only `python3` (3.9+). Run `python3 scripts/vtl_migration.py --help`.

The agent migrates each file in between, in the default **inline** mode (see `SKILL.md` → Output
Modes).

Enumerate the MCP server's tools and read their descriptions; each description is the source of
truth for how to call it. Search the spec to confirm an endpoint before calling it. Use the
asset-transfer tool for downloads when it can reach the file.

## Ground rules

- **Work in batches the customer picks.** Never migrate and publish the whole instance in one go
  unless they ask for it.
- **Nothing is written to the instance until the customer has confirmed** the summary of changes
  (step 5) and has seen a dry run (step 6).
- **One bad item never blocks the batch.** `check` reports each entry on its own; record it and
  carry on.
- **Never edit `manifest.json` by hand.** Use `record`.

## Working directory

`./vtl-migration/` is the script's default `--workdir`; never commit it.

```
vtl-migration/
  scan/part-N.json                    you write: the custom fields (step 1)
  assets/<id>.json                    you write: metadata of each /dA/ reference (step 2)
  original/assets/<id>__<file>        downloaded (step 2)
  original/fields/<Type.field>.vtl    written by classify
  migrated/...                        you write: same relative path as original/ (step 4)
  manifest.json                       written by the script
```

`manifest.json` has one entry per thing to change, each with `status` (`pending`, `published`,
`skipped`, `failed`) and `statusReason`:

| `kind` | Meaning | Key |
|---|---|---|
| `asset` | A file loaded by `#dotParse("/dA/<id>")` | the identifier |
| `field` | VTL stored in the custom field itself | `Type.field` |
| `renderMode` | A field to switch to **Recommended**; `requires` lists the assets to publish first | `Type.field` |

## 1. Discover

Read every content type's custom fields through the MCP server, and write them to
`vtl-migration/scan/part-N.json` as arrays of records. This snippet (run with the MCP
`execute` tool) returns one slice of the content types; call it again with the next `start` until
`done` is true, and shrink `count` if the output is cut off:

```js
const start = 0, count = 25;
const CUSTOM = 'com.dotcms.contenttype.model.field.ImmutableCustomField';
const out = [];
for (const t of contentTypes.slice(start, start + count)) {
  const res = await api.request({ method: 'GET', path: `/api/v1/contenttype/id/${t.id}` });
  for (const f of res.entity.fields || []) {
    if (f.clazz !== CUSTOM) continue;
    out.push({
      type: t.variable, typeId: t.id, field: f.variable, fieldId: f.id,
      values: f.values || '',
      component: (f.fieldVariables || []).some(v => v.key === 'newRenderMode' && v.value === 'component'),
    });
  }
}
return { done: start + count >= contentTypes.length, records: out };
```

Write each slice's `records` array to its own file in `scan/`, then:

```bash
python3 scripts/vtl_migration.py classify
```

`classify` sorts every custom field and prints counts, the `/dA/` ids to resolve
(`assetsToResolve`) and the report-only buckets:

| Finding in `values` | Category | What happens |
|---|---|---|
| One or more `#dotParse("/dA/<id>")` | Downloadable file | Resolved in step 2; queued if legacy |
| `#dotParse` of any other path | Unhandled path | Report only |
| `$velutil.mergeTemplate('...')` or `#parse('...')` | Core-shipped file | Report only; the file ships inside dotCMS |
| Contains `isNewEditModeEnabled` | Already migrated | Report only; a `renderMode` entry is queued if the field is not in Recommended mode |
| Contains `dojo.`, `dijit`, `dojoType` or `DotCustomFieldApi.get/set/onChangeField(` | In-field legacy VTL | Written to `original/fields/` and queued as a `field` entry |
| None of the above | Already fine | Nothing to do |

## 2. Resolve and download the files

For every id in `assetsToResolve`, fetch the content's metadata and write it to
`assets/<id>.json`:

```js
const ids = ['<id>', '<id>'];
const out = {};
for (const id of ids) {
  const res = await api.request({ method: 'GET', path: `/api/v1/content/${id}` });
  const c = res.entity;
  if (!c) { out[id] = null; continue; }
  const bin = ['asset', 'fileAsset'].find(k => `${k}ContentAsset` in c)
    || Object.keys(c).find(k => k.endsWith('ContentAsset'))?.replace(/ContentAsset$/, '');
  out[id] = {
    identifier: c.identifier, inode: c.inode, languageId: c.languageId, contentType: c.contentType,
    live: c.live, fileName: c.fileName, name: c.name, title: c.title, binaryField: bin,
    path: c.path, hostName: c.hostName,
  };
}
return out;
```

A `null` or an id without a usable result gets no file; the script reports it as unresolved.
Then:

```bash
python3 scripts/vtl_migration.py assets-plan
```

It prints `toDownload` (each with its `destination` path and the dotCMS `path`/`hostName` to
fetch), plus `pinned` (the field points at an inode, not the identifier: report only, because
publishing always lands on the latest version), `unresolved` and `alreadyMigrated`. Download each
`toDownload` file to its `destination` with the asset-download tool. If the tool cannot reach the
file by path, read it with `GET /api/v1/content/<id>`'s `<binaryField>Version` URL through
`execute` (the response is a base64 envelope) and write the decoded bytes. Then:

```bash
python3 scripts/vtl_migration.py build-manifest --instance <host>
```

This builds `manifest.json` (a downloaded file that already has `isNewEditModeEnabled` counts as
already migrated) and prints the counts, the entries and the report-only buckets. Re-running
steps 1-2 after a publish does not download again a file that is already migrated.

## 3. Show what's pending and let the customer pick

Build one numbered table from `build-manifest`'s `entries` (or `status`), nothing migrated yet:

| # | VTL | Kind | Used by |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `text-count.vtl` | `/dA/` file | 5 fields: `Destination.pageTitleCount`, … |
| 2 | `Banner.widget` | inline field | `Banner.widget` |

List `renderMode` entries with an empty `requires` as one extra row ("Switch to Recommended
only: …"). Do not list those with `requires`: they go along with their asset. Sum up the
report-only buckets in one line of counts ("25 load core files, 3 use unhandled paths, say
*details* to see them"). Ask which rows to do now: `all`, row numbers (`1,3`) or `none`, and wait.

## 4. Migrate the selected files

Migrate each selected file in `original/` in the default inline mode and write the result to
`migrated/` under the same relative path. Assemble the file with the shell recipe in `SKILL.md`
(Mode 1) so the legacy bytes are copied, never retyped.

## 5. Confirm

Summarize what changed per file and get the customer's explicit confirmation before touching the
instance.

## 6. Dry run, then publish only that batch

Pass the selected rows' keys (the dA id for a file, `Type.field` for an inline field or a switch).

```bash
python3 scripts/vtl_migration.py check --dry-run --only <key...>
```

`check` runs the gates and gives a verdict per entry. Show it to the customer, then run it again
without `--dry-run` (that also records the `skipped` ones):

| Verdict | Meaning | What you do |
|---|---|---|
| `ready` | Every gate passed; `action` says what to publish | Write it to the instance (below), then `record` |
| `skipped` | A gate failed (`reason`): the migrated file is identical to the original, is not an inline migration, or does not keep the original verbatim behind the switch | Report it; fix the migration and `check --retry`, or leave it |
| `waiting` | No migrated file yet, or an asset it depends on is not published yet | Stays pending |
| `done` | Already finished; named again only with `--retry` | Nothing |

Selecting an asset also selects the fields that load it, so they switch to Recommended in the same
run. Their entries are `waiting` until the asset is `published` in the manifest: publish the assets
first, `record` them, and run `check --only <same keys>` again to unlock the switches.

For each `ready` entry, in order, run the matching write with the MCP `execute` tool, then record
the outcome **immediately** so an interrupted run leaves an accurate manifest. Run
`python3 scripts/vtl_migration.py payload <key>` to get the values to embed (as JSON literals).

**`publish-asset`.** Check nothing changed since the download, then fire PUBLISH on the existing
identifier with the migrated file, so `#dotParse("/dA/<id>")` keeps working:

```js
const p = /* paste the output of `payload <key>` */;
const current = (await api.request({ method: 'GET', path: `/api/v1/content/${p.identifier}` })).entity;
if (!current || current.inode !== p.expectedInode) {
  return { outcome: 'skipped', reason: 'changed on the server since download' };
}
const res = await api.request({
  method: 'PUT',
  path: '/api/v1/workflow/actions/default/fire/PUBLISH',
  query: { identifier: p.identifier, language: p.languageId, indexPolicy: 'WAIT_FOR' },
  formData: {
    json: JSON.stringify({ contentlet: { contentType: p.contentType, identifier: p.identifier }, binaryFields: [p.binaryField] }),
    file: { name: p.fileName, type: 'text/plain', data: p.contentBase64 },
  },
});
const inode = res && res.entity && res.entity.inode;
return inode ? { outcome: 'published', inode } : { outcome: 'failed', reason: 'published but the response had no inode; verify manually' };
```

Then `record <key> --status published --inode <inode>`, or `--status skipped|failed --reason "..."`.
If the inode could not be read, record `failed`, never `published`.

**`update-field`.** Save the migrated code **and** `newRenderMode` = `component` in one update. The
v3 update rebuilds the field and replaces the variables list wholesale, so send the field exactly as
fetched with every other variable kept:

```js
const p = /* paste the output of `payload <key>` */;
const url = `/api/v1/contenttype/${p.typeId}/fields/id/${p.fieldId}`;
const field = (await api.request({ method: 'GET', path: url })).entity;
if (!field || (field.values || '') !== p.original) {
  return { outcome: 'skipped', reason: 'changed on the server since download' };
}
const vars = field.fieldVariables || [];
const existing = vars.find(v => v.key === 'newRenderMode') || {};
const flag = { ...existing, clazz: 'com.dotcms.contenttype.model.field.ImmutableFieldVariable',
               key: 'newRenderMode', value: 'component', fieldId: field.id };
const updated = { ...field, values: p.migrated, fieldVariables: [...vars.filter(v => v.key !== 'newRenderMode'), flag] };
await api.request({ method: 'PUT', path: `/api/v3/contenttype/${p.typeId}/fields/${p.fieldId}`, body: { field: updated } });
return { outcome: 'published' };
```

**`set-render-mode`.** The same update without changing `values`: skip if the field already has
`newRenderMode` = `component`, otherwise send it with only that variable changed.

Treat any request error as `failed` for that entry and carry on with the rest of the batch.

## 7. Report and offer the next batch

```bash
python3 scripts/vtl_migration.py status
```

Say what was published, skipped (and why), failed or is waiting, name the fields that were switched
to Recommended, then show what is still `pending` and ask whether to continue. Unselected rows stay
pending; nothing is lost by stopping. Entries that finished are not reprocessed unless the customer
names one to retry (`check --retry`). In a later session start again from step 1: the manifest
remembers which files are already migrated, so only what is left is downloaded.

A migrated field only renders natively in the new editor once it is in the **Recommended**
implementation (`newRenderMode` = `component`).
